How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?  What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is the intermediary between the working directory and the repository.  It allows the user to select which files get added to the repository.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
The staging area gives the user the opportunity to compare the differences between the working directory, the staging area, and the repository (last commit).  Use the git diff and git diff --staged commands.

How do diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
