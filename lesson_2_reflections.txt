1.  How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?  What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is the intermediary between the working directory and the repository.  It allows the user to select which files get added to the repository.

2.  How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
The staging area gives the user the opportunity to compare the differences between the working directory, the staging area, and the repository (last commit).  Use the git diff and git diff --staged commands.

3.  How do diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
It allows to trace back to each parent commit as long as the branch has a name.  Unnamed branches can get lost.

4,  What is the result of merging two branches together?  Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?
Merging combines the changes made on two different branches.  The representation of the branch structure allows the individual commits to be accessible by the master branch.

5.  What are the pros and cons of Git's automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?
Git's automatic merging combines changes from two branches and consolidates them into one branch.  If there are no conflicts, the process completes automatically.  If there are conflicts, they must be resolved manually before continuing with the merge.
