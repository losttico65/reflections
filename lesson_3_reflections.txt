When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    Fill in your answer here
    When collaborating with other people, or when working from different locations or using different computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Fill in your answer here
    This gives you the ability to evaluate changes before pulling them into the local repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fill in your answer here
    Forks are use solely within GitHub.  They are used to copy and diverge repositories.
    Clones are used to replicate remote and local repositories.
    Branches are used within a repository to create separate development paths that maybe merged later.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    Fill in your answer here
    It helps minimize conflicts when collaborating with others.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Fill in your answer here
    To collaborate without using a version control system like Git or GitHub, the participants would have to interact and coordinate very well the changes they make.  It would be harder to work offline or offsite and, if done, could lead to greater difficulty integrating the different parts into the product.  The only thing that would be easier is not having to learn to use a version control system.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
